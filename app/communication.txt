Communication is very important aspect which may help us in our progress. Sometimes we may end up in a problem that we are unable to solve. We may communicate our problem to others who may already have a solution or may help us to find solution to the problem in quicker and more efficient way. It may be possible for us to solve the problem that arise but sometimes it may take lots of time and efforts, so it’s better to communicate our problem so that we can receive a help from others.
Two types of people never communicate, one who is afraid of speaking and one who is to confident that he can solve the problem on its own. There may be times when a confident person is able to solve the problem on its own, but some problem would require some assistant so that they can be solved in more efficient way and before the deadline. 
It’s good to try to solve a problem by our self but if we are stuck into a problem, it’s wise to communicate our problems and take help from others, rather than just being too confident that you can solve a problem.  We should be good in commutate by any means be it be email or a verbal telephonic conversation.  Good communication would help us to convey our problems and doubts in a way that others can understand it. 
We must always post our doubt on Redmine system if we are stuck for more than half an hour on particular problem. We should ask for help rather being self centered.
